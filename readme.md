> You can also say that ‘something is going to happen’ in the future. For example:

The man isn’t looking where he is going.  
He `is going to walk` into the wall.  
When we say that `‘something is going to happen’`,  
the situation now makes this clear.  
The man is walking towards the wall now, so we can see that he `is going to walk` into it.

eg:

> After `if`, we normally use the present (if I do / if I see etc.) for the future:

* JOE: How are you going to travel?
* JESS: We’re going to take the train. If we `took` the bus, it `would` be cheaper, but the train is quicker.

> Sarah doesn’t know Paul’s number, so she says `if I knew`.    
> She imagines what she would do if she knew his number

> We use the past in the same way aft er wish (I wish I knew / I wish you were etc.). We use wish to say that we regret something, that something is not as we would like it to be:

## `it is said that …` `he is said to …` `he is supposed to …`

> George is very old. Nobody knows exactly how old he is. Both these sentences mean: ‘People say that he is 108 years old.’
* `It is said that` he is 108 years old. or `He is said to` be 108 years old.

> You can use `supposed to …` in the same way as `said to …` :
* I want to see that film. It’s supposed to be good. (= people say it’s good)
* There are many stories about Joe. He’s supposed to have robbed a bank many years ago.

> Sometimes supposed to … has a different meaning. We use supposed to to say what is intended, arranged or expected. Often this is different from the real situation:

* What are you doing at work? You’re supposed to be on holiday. (= you arranged to be on holiday)

* b: No, I made them myself.

> We also use have something done with a diff erent meaning. For example:
* Paul and Karen `had` their bags `stolen` while they were travelling.
> This does not mean that they arranged for somebody to steal their bags. ‘They `had` their bags `stolen`’ means only: `‘Their bags were stolen’`.   
> With this meaning, we use have something done to say that something happens to somebody or their belongings:  
* Gary `had` his nose `broken` in a fight. (= his nose was broken)
* Have you ever `had` your bike `stolen`?

## `get` something `done`
> You can say ‘get something done’ instead of ‘have something done’:
